How do you see data?

## Purpose
It's not easy to see or understand how much data a network is actually using in realtime, nor is it intuitive to visualize with graphs and monitors.
Digital Flow aims to change that by visually representing a networks data flow with water flowing through a water wheel.

## Setup
* A raspi as a transparent proxy to the router or a router/switch that can port mirror is necessary to see the network's data in totality.
* A wifi arduino to control the pump motor and recieve updates
